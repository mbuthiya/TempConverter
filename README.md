# TempConverter

Simple C program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula.
C =(5/9)(F-32)


The sample output looks like this.

```bash
```

## Running on Unix

To run your command on a Linux system you need a c compiler installed.

```bash
$ gcc temp.c -o temp
```

This compiles the code and creates a source code file called `temp`

To run that source code file

```bash
$ ./temp
```

100 	 37
120 	 48
140 	 60
160 	 71
180 	 82
200 	 93

```

## Running on Unix

To run your command on a Linux system you need a c compiler installed.

```bash
$ gcc convert.c -o convert
```

This compiles the code and creates a source code file called `convert`

To run that source code file

```bash
$ ./convert
```

# TempConverter

Simple C program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula.
C =(5/9)(F-32)


The sample output looks like this.

```bash
Fahr    Celsius
  0    -17.8
 20     -6.7
 40      4.4
 60     15.6
 80     26.7
100     37.8
120     48.9
140     60.0
160     71.1
180     82.2
200     93.3
220    104.4
240    115.6
260    126.7
280    137.8
300    148.9

```

## Running on Unix

To run your command on a Linux system you need a c compiler installed.

```bash
$ gcc convert.c -o convert
```

This compiles the code and creates a source code file called `convert`

To run that source code file

```bash
$ ./convert
```

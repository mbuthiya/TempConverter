# Hello World

First C program attempt to create a program that prints out "Hello, World!" on the terminal.


```bash
$ Hello World
```

## Running on Unix

To run your command on a Linux system you need a c compiler installed.

```bash
$ gcc hello.c -o hello
```

This compiles the code and creates a source code file called `hello`

To run that source code file

```bash
$ ./hello
```
